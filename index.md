# about

This website was created by Robert Eggleston, using Github Pages, at the end of Julley 2021 as his final project for the 2021 NFB EQ program.

The NFB EQ program is a 4 week engearing program for the visually impared, run by the National Federation of the Blind, in which students practice their spacel thinking skills by learning about a range of topics including technical multiview drawing, puzzles, legos, Menger Sponges, and origami. 

At the end of the program, the students create projects demonstrating what they had learned in a learning resource designed for the rest of the blind community, Robert, oviously, chose origami.
