# The Diagonal Fold
The diagonal fold is a commonly used and simple fold.
To create it, fold the paper such that one corner meats the corner on the opposite corner, for example, the northwest corner meats the southeast. (when the paper is folded along the crease, the paper will be shaped like a right triangle, and when it is unfolded, there should be a fold line running diagonally through the center of the paper.
