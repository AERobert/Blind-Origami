# Models
Models, or designs, are the finished product of origami. 
Some take 10 to 20 minutes, while others take up to 16 hours to complete.
Some represent tessellations and other mathematical concepts, and others represent various plants, animals, and objects.


## model difficulty
The standardized rating system for origami models consists of six levels.

- simple
- low intermediate
- intermediate
- high intermediate
- complex
- super complex

The models covered by this website will not go above the high intermediate rating.


## covered models
This website currently only contains instructions for three models, though more will be added in the near future.
