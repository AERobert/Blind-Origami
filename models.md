# Models
Models, or designs, are the finished product of origami. 
Some take 10 to 20 minutes, while others take up to 16 hours to complete.
Some represent tessellations and other mathematical concepts, and others represent various plants, animals, and objects.


## model difficulty
The standardized rating system for origami models consists of six levels.
