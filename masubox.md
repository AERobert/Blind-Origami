# Instructions to make a Masu box

## step 1
Create a [Blintz Base](blintz.md)
### 1.1 Fold the paper on the north/south axis. (Your paper should look like a vertical rectangle)
#### 1.1.1 
Crease and unfold the paper (Their should now be a fold line running down the center of the paper)

### 1.2 Fold the paper along the west/east axis. (The paper should now look like a horizontal rectangle)
#### 1.2.1
Crease and unfold. (their should now be two perpendicular lines that intersect in the middle of the paper)

### 1.3 Fold each corner of the paper into the center of the paper. (After this step, you should have a folded square with 4 triangles on top)


## step 2
Fold the Blitz base into a 4 by 4 grid.

### 2.1
Fold the Blitz base on the north/south axis.  (your blintz base should now look like a vertical rectangle)
#### 2.1.1
Crease and unfold. (there should now be a line running down the center of the blintz base.

### 2.2
Fold the blintz base on the east/west axis. (the paper should now look like a horizontal rectangle.
#### 2.2.1
Crease and unfold. (the blitz base should now be divided into four quadrants.)


### 2.3 Fold the left side of the blintz base so that the edge meats the north/south crease. (repeat this on the right half of the blitz base as well) (now the blintz base should look similar to a set of closed, double doors(
#### 2.3.1
Unfold the blintz base into 4 vertical rectangles.
### 2.4 Turn the blitz base 90Â°, and repeat step 2.3. (the blitz base should now resemble a 4 by 4 grid)


## step 3
Finish the box

### 3.1 Lift the east and west portions of the grid to form two walls. (You should have a a shape resembling a long and short print letter u, with two 4 by 1 walls on either side, and a two by 4 base)

### 3.2
Feel along the southern triangle, locate the two right triangles on each side, pinch these together with the east and west walls. (The box should now have 3 walls, with two triangular flaps where the walls meet)

### 3.3
repeat the previous two steps on the northern triangle. (Your masu box should now be done! with four walls and four flaps securing them)
