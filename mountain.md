### The Mountain fold
The mountain fold is the inverse of the valley fold, in deed, if you turn the paper over, any mountains will look like valleys and any valleys will look like mountains.
When unfolded, the mountain appears to rise off the paper.
To create this fold, you have to fold one of the edges under another edge, or, if you find this to difficult, you can just make a valley fold on the other side of the paper, since the two are inverses.
