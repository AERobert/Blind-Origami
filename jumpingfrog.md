# The origami jumping frog

## Folding instructions

### Step 1
Make a folded square

#### 1.1
Fold the paper along the north/south axis. (Now the paper should be a vertical two layer rectangle)

#### Fold the rectangle so that the northern edge meets the southern edge of paper. (Now the paper should be a four layered square)
##### 1.2.1
Fold the top two layers of the square back to meet the northern edge of the square, crease. (Now the northern half of the square should be a six layered rectangle and the southern half should only consist of two layers)
##### 1.2.2 Flip the paper over, and repeat 1.2.1 on this side. (Now the paper should resemble a eight layered rectangle, folded like a accordion)
##### 1.2.3
Flip the model back over, and unfold the rectangle back until the vertical rectangle created in 1.1. (Now the folded rectangle should have three vertical lines, one valley in the middle and one mountain to the north and south of it, separating the paper into four rectangular subsections.

#### 1.3 Fold the northeastern corner of the rectangle so it meets the western end of the central [valley](valley.md) fold, crease and unfold. (now there should be a northwest/southeast [diagonal](diagonal.md) [valley](valley.md) fold line running through the northern half of the rectangle)
##### 1.3.1
Repeat this step with the northwestern corner, folding it to the eastern end of the central [valley](valley.md) fold. (now there should be three creases on the northern half of the rectangle, a [mountain](mountain.md) fold dividing it in half horizontally, and two [diagonal](diagonal.md) [valley](valley.md) folds running northwest/southeast and northeast/southwest)

#### 1.4
Repeat Step 3 on the southern half of the rectangle. (now both the north and south half of the rectangle should have three creases, a east/west [mountain](mountain.md) fold, and two [diagonal](diagonal.md) [valley](valley.md) folds)

#### 1.5 Lift the northern half of the rectangle at a 90 degree angle to the rest of the rectangle, place your fingers on the east and west ends of the horizontal [mountain](mountain.md) fold running through this portion of the model, and push the crease in and down towards the model, if the other creases are done correctly, the northern half of the paper should collapse into a triangle, with a right triangle flap on each side. (Now the northern half of the paper should be a four layer triangle separated into a east and west half, each with a flap on top of it)

#### 1.6 repeat 1.5 on the southern half of the rectangle. (now the model should be a square, with a open horizontal crease running through the center, and four right triangle flaps on each edge.)


### step 2
Making the frog
#### 2.1 With the square’s corners “alined” to the cardinal directions, lift the northwestern flap, and fold it so that it’s point meets the northern corner, Crease and unfold. (Now the northwestern flap should have a [valley](valley.md) fold half way down it’s length.
##### 2.1.1 Lift the northwestern flap along the crease created in the last step, and fold it so it’s tip protrudes out of the model slightly, the exact sizing does not madder. (Now the northwestern flap should stick out the northwestern edge of the model, this will be one of the frog’s legs)


##### 2.1.2
Repeat the last two steps on the northwestern flap.

#### 2.2 (Now both the northeastern and northwestern flaps should extend off of the model as two of the legs)

#### 2.2
Repeat 2.1 on the southern half of the paper, starting by folding the flaps to the southern point of the square. (Now all four of the flaps should be formed into legs)

#### 2.3
Fold the model along the north/south axis so that the east and west corners of the model meet, crease and unfold. (So far, the four flaps should have been formed into legs, and there should be two [valley](valley.md) folds running between the east/west and north/south corners of the model)

#### 2.4
Fold the southern point of the model so it meets the central intersection of the two [mountain](mountain.md) folds, in the center of the model, crease. (now there should be a flat [folded edge](foldededge.md) at the south of the model on which is a triangular flap, with a north/south [valley](valley.md) crease dividing it, while the overall model should roughly be shaped like a pentagon, with a large triangle in the north.)

#### 2.4
Fold the western corner of the model so that it meets the southern end of the [valley](valley.md) fold running through the center of the triangular flap on the southern half of the model, crease. (Now the western portion of the paper should consist of a right triangular flap, whose hypotenuse is the folded western edge)
##### Repeat the last step on the eastern corner of the model. (Now the overall model should be a rough isosceles triangle, with the four leg flaps protruding from the west, southwest, southeast, and east corners.

#### 2.5
Flip the paper over, and fold the southern edge up so the leg flaps meet, crease. (The bottom part of the model should now be a rectangle, with the leg flaps aligned on each other.)
##### 2.5.1
Fold the flap, created in this step, back so it again meats the southern edge. (If all of the folds are correct, the frog base should be complete! The northern part should be a triangle, pointing north representing the frog’s head, with a north/south [mountain](mountain.md) running down it, and the southern part of the model should consist of a rectangle, where the frog’s front legs stick out on the northern half, and the southern half consists of the back legs, folded like a accordion.))


### step 3
Making it jump
After placing the frog on it’s legs, just push down on the accordion like fold at the back of the frog, and release, if all goes well, it should jump!
