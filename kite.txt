# The Kite Fold
The kite fold is one of the simplest folds in origami.
It is called a kite fold because, well, itâ€™s shaped like a kite.
## Folding instructions
1. Make a [diagonal fold](diagonal.md), and unfold the paper. (your paper should now have a single diagonal fold line running between two of the cornors)
2. fold the two cornors not connected by the crease in to the center of the paper. (You are now done with the kite base, your paper should now be shaped like a ... kite.)
