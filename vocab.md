# Folded and raw edges

In origami, there are two types of edges.

## The [folded edge](foldededge.md):

A folded edge is an edge where two or more layers of paper are folded together. If the paper was unfolded, their would be a crease line in the same possition on the other side of the paper.


## The [raw edge](rawedge.md):
A raw edge is an edge of paper that has not been folded, and is made up of a single layer of paper.
