# Folded and raw edges

In origami, there are two types of edges.

## The [folded edge](foldededge.md):

A folded edge is an edge where two or more layers of paper are folded together. If the paper was unfolded, their would be a crease line in the same possition on the other side of the paper.


## The [raw edge](rawedge.md):
A raw edge is an edge of paper that has not been folded, and is made up of a single layer of paper.


## Folds

The various folds are the building blocks of origami, they are what turns a flat sheet of paper into a intricate work of art.

There are 10 different commonly used folds in origami.
Some are probably used in almost any project, such as the [mountain](mountain.md) and [valley](valley.md) folds, while others are reserved for more complex models.


### basic folds
The two most commonly used folds are the [valley](valley.md) and [mountain](mountain.md) folds.

#### The Valley fold
The Valley fold gets it's name from the fact that when unfolded, it's fold line sinks into  the paper.
It is created by folding one edge of a piece of paper over the other.

### The Mountain fold
The mountain fold is the inverse of the valley fold, in deed, if you turn the paper over, any mountains will look like valleys and any valleys will look like mountains.
When unfolded, mountain folds appear to rise off the paper.
To create this fold, you have to fold one of the edges under another edge, or, if you find this to difficult, you can just make a valley fold on the other side of the paper, since the two are inverses.
